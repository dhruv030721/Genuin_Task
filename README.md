## Optimized Performance & State Management

### âš¡ Features & Advantages

This project is designed for high performance, reliability, and scalability with the following key optimizations:

- **BLoC Pattern for State Management** separates UI from business logic, resulting in predictable state management, efficient performance, and scalable architecture.  
- **Hive for Memory Caching** ensures fast data retrieval and reduces redundant API calls, improving overall efficiency.  
- **Optimized Video Playback** with the `m3m8` file format enables smooth and efficient streaming for a better user experience.  
- **Retry Mechanism** provides a robust solution for handling network failures, ensuring uninterrupted functionality.  

By integrating these optimizations, the app ensures a seamless, high-performance experience while maintaining clean and maintainable code.
